Nobel Prize winning neuroscientist Dr. Skinner has developed a miracle cure-all drug with no apparent drawbacks called Hapuna. Hapuna soon becomes ubiquitous... and essential. However, soon after Hapuna is officially introduced, Dr. Skinner vanishes.\\n\\nThree years later, the world has moved on. But Dr. Skinner has returned\\u2014this time, as a harbinger of doom. Skinner announces that Hapuna has a short half-life. Everyone who has taken it will die approximately three years later. Death is coming for this sinful world\\u2014and coming soon.\\n\\nAs a response to this threat, a special task force of five agents is gathered from across the world to save humanity from Skinner\\u2019s plan. This group is called \\"Lazarus.\\" Can they find Skinner and develop a vaccine before time runs out?\\n\\n(Source: Adult Swim, edited)",
